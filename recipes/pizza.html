    <h1> Amazing Pizza</h1>
    <img src="Pizza.jpg" alt="pizza whole with a slice being taken out">
    <p>Looking for vegetarian pizza topping ideas? 
        How about this restaurant-level vegetarian combination of spinach, pine nuts 
        and fontina cheese? We’ve used a pinsa romana (roman-style) pizza base.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tsp chopped fresh thyme</li>
        <li>250g spinach leaves, washed</li>
        <li>2 pinsa romana bases</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the onion, garlic and thyme with some salt 
            and pepper over a low-medium heat for 10 minutes until well softened. 
            Add the spinach, stir and cook for 1-2 minutes or until just wilted. 
            Remove from the heat and leave to cool (see Make Ahead).</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 230°C/210°C fan/gas 8. Divide the spinach mixture 
            between the 2 bases, then top with the fontina/mozzarella, pine nuts and 
            parmesan. Cook for 6-8 minutes until the toppings are melted and golden.</li>
    </ol>
